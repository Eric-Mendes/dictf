# Contributing Guidelines
> Make sure that you read our [code of conduct](https://github.com/Eric-Mendes/dictf/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before contributing with anything. It ensures a fun and safe community for everyone!

Thanks for considering making this project even better! :sparkles:

## How can I contribute
- You can file issues to report bugs, ask for enhancements or give our contributors a brand new idea on how to expand this project.
  - When opening a new issue, make sure that you follow the guidelines on how to do so;
- You can contribute with your really nice piece of code that will solve a bug, implement an enhancement or implement a brand new feature. 
- You can also contribute with documentation (this is much appreciated, btw). 

To do so, please follow the instructions below.

## Setting up the development environment
Install the package locally in your environment with the command below and code away!
```bash
pip install -e .[dev]
```
## Git Workflow (Feature Branch)
Whenever you want to contribute with code - whatever code it is - please make sure that you follow these rules (the same follows for documentation):
1. Fork the project;
2. Test your code before opening the Pull Request. Please remember to submit your new tests as well when opening the PR (if you are submitting new code);
3. Open the Pull Request.
Please be specific and clear about what your code or documentation tackles. Styles and naming conventions are described below.

For a more detailed explanation on the gitflow, please refer to [Github's official documentation about it](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects).

### Commit message styles
- Make sure that your commit messages follow one of these patterns: 
  - `noun: my message`;
  - `noun(scope): my message` (*preferred whenever possible*)

**Note -** `noun` is either `fix`, `feat`, `test`, `chore`, `refactor`, `style` or `doc`.

Have fun!
